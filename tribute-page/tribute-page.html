            <ul id="dates">
                <li><strong>3 January 1892</strong> - Birth of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien in Bloemfontein, Orange Free
                    State
                    (now part of South Africa).</li>
                <li><strong>21 January 1889</strong> - Birth of Edith Mary Bratt, Tolkien’s future wife, in Gloucester.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1902</strong> - The Tolkiens move to Edgbaston, Birmingham. The boys are enrolled at St
                    Philip’s Grammar School, but later in the year Ronald is educated at home.</li>
                <li><strong>Autumn Term 1907</strong> - Tolkien probably invents his private language ‘Naffarin’ based
                    on
                    Spanish and Latin.</li>
                <li><strong>1908</strong> - The boys move to Duchess Road and live with Mrs. Faulkner. Tolkien meets
                    Edith
                    Bratt, another lodger.</li>
                <li><strong>17 December 1910</strong> - Tolkien obtains a scholarship at Oxford’s Exeter College.</li>
                <li><strong>October 1911</strong> - Tolkien begins studying at Oxford.</li>
                <li><strong>1913</strong> - Tolkien writes to Edith on his 21st birthday, and soon after they become
                    engaged</li>
                <li><strong>24 September 1914</strong> Tolkien writes his first identifiable “Middle-earth” fragment
                    ‘The
                    Voyage of Éarendel the Evening Star’.</li>
                <li><strong>22 March 1916</strong -> Ronald and Edith are married in Warwick.</li>
                <li><strong>6 June 1916</strong> - Tolkien travels to France. On the boat he writes the poem ‘The Lonely
                    Isle’. Tolkien becomes a Battalion Signalling Officer.</li>
                <li><strong>9 November 1916</strong> - Suffering from trench fever, Tolkien returns to England.</li>
                <li><strong>Spring 1917</strong> - ‘The Fall of Gondolin’ is probably written before June. He is posted
                    to
                    Yorkshire, but he suffers recurring bouts of illness.</li>
                <li><strong>c. May 1917</strong> - Tolkien is inspired by watching Edith dance in a ‘hemlock’ glade near
                    Roos. This is the germ for the meeting of Lúthien and Beren in his legendarium.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer 1930</strong> - About this time, Tolkien may have written the first sentence of The
                    Hobbit: “In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit“.</li>
                <li><strong>21 September 1937</strong> -The Hobbit is published. Because of its success, Stanley Unwin
                    subsequently urges Tolkien to write a sequel, which he begins. This is the germ of The Lord of the
                    Rings</li>
                <li><strong>29 July 1954</strong> - Publication of The Fellowship of the Ring.</li>
