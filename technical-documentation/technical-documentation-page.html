                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Mass Effect is a military science fiction media franchise created by Casey Hudson.
                    The franchise depicts a distant future where humanity and several alien civilizations
                    have colonized the galaxy using technology left behind by advanced precursor civilizations.</p>
                <p>These consist of 8 subcategories which define different areas
                    of interest within the game that are key to the storyline of Mass Effect.</p>

                <h1>Council Races</h1>
                <p>The four most politically important species in the galaxy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Asari</strong></li>
                    <p>
                        The all female race, Asari were the first species to discover the Citadel. When the
                        salarians
                        arrived, it
                        was the asari who proposed the establishment of the Citadel Council to maintain peace
                        throughout
                        the galaxy.
                        Since then, the asari have served as the mediators and centrists of the Council.
                    </p>
                    <li><strong>Salarians</strong></li>
                    <p>
                        The second species to join the Citadel, the salarians are warm-blooded amphibians with a
                        hyperactive
                        metabolism. Salarians think fast, talk fast, and move fast. To salarians, other species seem
                        sluggish and
                        dull-witted. Unfortunately, their metabolic speed leaves them with a relatively short
                        lifespan;
                        salarians
                        over the age of 40 are a rarity.
                    </p>
                    <li><strong>Turians</strong></li>
                    <p>
                        Roughly 1200 years ago, the turians were invited to join the Citadel Council to fulfill the
                        role
                        of
                        galactic peacekeepers. The turians have the largest fleet in Citadel space, and they make up
                        the
                        single
                        largest portion of the Council's military forces.
                    </p>
                    <li><strong>Humans</strong></li>
                    <p>
                        In 2165, humanity was granted an embassy on the Citadel in recognition of their growing
                        power
                        and
                        influence
                        in the galactic community. The timing of this achievement, less than a decade after first
                        contact, caused
                        some friction with other Citadel races who had waited decades for such recognition.

                <article>
                    <p>A massive space station that serves as the political and economic capital of galactic
                        culture.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Citadel</li>
                        <p>The Citadel is an ancient deep-space station, presumably constructed by the Protheans.
                            Since
                            the Prothean
                            extinction, numerous species have come to call the Citadel home. It serves as the
                            political,
                            cultural, and
                            financial capital of the galactic community. To represent their interests, most species
                            maintain embassies
                            on the Presidium, the Citadel's inner ring.</p>
                        <li>Citadel Council</li>
                        <p>The Council is an executive committee composed of representatives from the Asari
                            Republics,
                            the Turian
                            Hierarchy, and the Salarian Union. Though they have no official power over the
                            independent
                            governments of
                            other species, the Council's decisions carry great weight throughout the galaxy. No
                            single
                            Council race is
                            strong enough to defy the other two, and all have a vested interest in compromise and
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <li>Citadel Space</li>
                        <p>Citadel Space is an unofficial term referring to any region of space controlled by a
                            species
                            that
                            acknowledges the authority of the Citadel Council. At first glance, it appears this
                            territory encompasses
                            most of the galaxy. In reality, however, less than 1% of the stars have been explored.
                        </p>
                        <li>Spectres</li>
                        <p>Spectres are agents from the Office of Special Tactics and Reconnaissance and answer only
                            to
                            the Citadel
                            Council. They are elite military operatives, granted the authority to deal with threats
                            to
                            peace and
                            stability in whatever way they deem necessary. Commander Shepard was the first Human
                            Spectre.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Various Organizations of the Galaxy</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cerberus</li>
                        <p>Immediately following the First Contact War, an anonymous extranet manifesto warned that
                            an
                            alien attempt
                            at human genocide was inevitable. The manifesto called for an army -- a Cerberus to
                            guard
                            against invasion
                            through the Charon relay.

                            Derided as "survivalist rhetoric written by an illusive man," the manifesto and its
                            anonymous author soon
                            fell off the media radar. But in 2165, terrorists stole antimatter from the SSV Geneva;
                            the
                            sole figure
                            arrested named his sponsor "Cerberus." Throughout the 2160s and 2170s, alleged Cerberus
                            agents
                            assassinated politicians, sabotaged starships bearing eezo, and conducted nightmarish
                            experiments on
                            aliens and humans. Denounced as human-supremacist, Cerberus calls itself
                            human-survivalist.
                        </p>
                        <li>The Illusive Man</li>
                        <p>The reclusive tycoon calling himself the Illusive Man is a human nationalist focused on
                            advancing human
                            interests, whatever the cost to non-humans. The Citadel Council regards him as a fanatic
                            posing a serious
                            threat to galactic security.</p>
                        <li>Mercenaries: Blue Suns</li>
                        <p>Founded by notorious batarian slaver Solem Dal'serah, the Blue Suns began as a Skyllian
                            Verge
                            protection
                            racket providing genuine protection from slavers and pirates. Eventually captured by the
                            Systems Alliance
                            Navy, Dal'serah beat almost two dozen charges to be convicted on a single count of
                            conspiracy. The slaver
                            benefited from the tutelage of cellmate and brilliant con artist Bernard "Legits"
                            Ledger.
                            Upon release
                            five years later, Dal'serah incorporated Blue Suns as a legal security agency.</p>
                        <li>Mercenaries: Blood Pack</li>
                        <p>Originally a small Terminus Systems vorcha gang, the Blood Pack was transformed into a
                            legion
                            by
                            visionary krogan battlemaster Ganar Wrang. Exiled for striking a female in anger, Wrang
                            obsessed over
                            reclaiming his lost status.</p>
                        <li>Mercenaries: Eclipse</li>
                        <p>Brainchild of asari commando Jona Sederis, Eclipse was incorporated as a "proactive"
                            security
                            company.
                            Influenced by asari and salarian military doctrine, Eclipse specializes in sabotage,
                            assassination, and
                            personal and organizational security. Although Citadel governments regard the
                            corporation
                            with suspicion,
                            it's embraced in the Skyllian Verge and Terminus Systems.</p>

                            independent decision
                            making. Creation of conscious AI requires adaptive code, a slow, expensive education,
                            and a
                            specialized
                            quantum computer called a "blue box".</p>
                        <li>Computers: Virtual Intelligence (VI)</li>
                        <p>A virtual intelligence is an advanced form of user interface software. VIs use a variety
                            of
                            methods to
                            simulate natural conversation, including an audio interface and an avatar personality to
                            interact with.
                            Although a VI can provide a convincing emulation of sentience, they are not self-aware,
                            nor
                            can they learn
                            or take independent action.</p>
                        <li>Element Zero ("Eezo")</li>
                        <p>When subjected to an electrical current, the rare material dubbed element zero, or
                            "eezo",
                            emits a dark
                            energy field that raises or lowers the mass of all objects within it. This "mass effect"
                            is
                            used in
                            countless ways, from generating artificial gravity to manufacturing high-strength
                            construction materials.
                            It is most prominently used to enable faster-than-light space travel.</p>
                        <li>Mass Effect Fields</li>
                        <p>Element zero can increase or decrease the mass of a volume of space-time when subjected
                            to an
                            electrical
                            current. With a positive current, mass is increased. With a negative current, mass is
                            decreased. The
                            stronger the current, the greater the magnitude of the dark energy mass effect.</p>
                        <li>Mass Relays</li>
                        <p>Mass relays are feats of Prothean engineering advanced far beyond the technology of any
                            living species.
                            They are enormous structures scattered throughout the stars, and can create corridors of
                            virtually
                            mass-free space allowing instantaneous transit between locations separated by years or
                            even
                            centuries of
                            travel using conventional FTL drives.</p>
                        <li>Medi-Gel</li>
                        <p>Medi-gel is a common medicinal salve used by paramedics, EMTs, and military personnel. It
                            combines
                            several useful applications: a local anesthetic, disinfectant, and clotting agent all in
                            one. Once
                            applied, the gel is designed to grip tight to flesh until subjected to a frequency of
                            ultrasound. It is
                            sealable against liquids--most notably blood--as well as contaminants and gases.</p>
                        <li>Omni-tool</li>
                        <p>Omni-tools are handheld devices that combine a computer microframe, sensor analysis pack,
                            and
                            minifacturing fabricator. Versatile and reliable, an omni-tool can be used to analyze
                            and
                            adjust the
                            functionality of most standard equipment, including weapons and armor, from a distance.

                        <li>The Crucible</li>
                        <p>The Mars Archives describe a superweapon that the Alliance has named the Crucible, which
                            exploits the
                            technology of mass effect relays. Beyond the basic principles, however, researchers know
                            little about how
                            the weapon actually works.</p>
                        <li>The Genophage</li>
                        <p>The genophage bioweapon was created to end the Krogan Rebellions. The turians fought the
                            krogan to a
                            standstill, but the sheer weight of krogan numbers indicated they could not be stopped
                            through
                            conventional means. The turians collaborated with the salarians to engineer a genetic
                            counter to the
                            krogan's rapid breeding.</p>
                        <li>The Genophage Cure</li>
                        <p>It may be possible to reverse the genophage by extracting an immunity from the genetic
                            data
                            of a cured
                            krogan female. A salarian geneticist named Maelon, a former student of Dr. Mordin Solus,
                            discovered the
                            cure through unethical experimentation on live subjects.</p>

                <h1>The Reapers</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>A myth common to several cultures in the galaxy, Reapers were once imagined as space monsters
                        that consumed
                        entire stars. Archeologists who searched for the sources of such myths found little besides
                        the
                        themes of
                        all-consuming devils that are common to primitive cultures.

                        Although accurate information about the Reapers remains scarce, the galaxy now knows that
                        the
                        Reapers are
                        not a myth--they are a real and devastating threat.</p>
